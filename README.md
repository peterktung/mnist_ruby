##Code Sample of "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" in Ruby

This is simply a rewrite of https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning in Ruby for personal understanding. 

The code runs very slowly, so it's only good for additional notes I made during the re-write, but if you want to see it run:
```
ruby mnist_loader.rb
```
